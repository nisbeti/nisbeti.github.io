title: Ian Nisbet's Career Overview
---
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>I have worked programming web applications since 1998, initially with ASP, then Perl, then PHP. 
I have setup, configured and deployed on Windows and Linux servers, using SQL Server and MySQL in production. 
  Throughout my career as a programmer, parnter in an web agency, manager, teacher, and company director, I have always come back to developing.</p>
  
<p>While a teacher, I was also developing the school Managed Learning Environment (MLE), along with personal projects at home. 
While a manager in a college, I was also developing and maintaining three versions of the college MLE and Student Information System.</p>

<p>I am very much a programmer at heart, and have never stopped learning and adapting to the changing world of Web programming, 
  which is still just as an exciting place as it was in the mid 90s.</p>

<p>In my day job, as a lead developer, I programme Laravel based systems with Vue JS front ends.</p>
