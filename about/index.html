title: Ian Nisbet's Career Overview
---
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>I have worked programming web applications since 1998, initially with ASP, then Perl, then PHP. 
I have setup, configured and deployed on Windows and Linux servers, using SQL Server and MySQL in production. 
  Throughout my career as a programmer, parter in an web agency, manager, teacher, and company director, I have always come back to developing.</p>
  
<p>While a teacher, I was also developing the school Managed Learning Environment (MLE), along with personal projects at home. 
While a Manager in a college, I was also developing and maintaining three versions of the college MLE and Student Information System.</p>

<p>I had been integrating more and more Laravel components into a Slim framework base, 
until I decided to re-write the whole system using only Laravel.
  I have written my fair share of "legacy" code, but am now completely OO.</p>

<p>In 2006 I re-trained as a Maths teacher, although I soon fell back into a programming role, porting my old Perl MLE code to PHP.</p>

<p>I am very much a programmer at heart, and have never stopped learning and adapting to the changing world of Web programming, 
  which is still just as an exciting place as it was in the mid 90s.</p>
