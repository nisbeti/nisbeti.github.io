	<h1>Hi there, I'm Ian Nisbet!</h1>
	<p>I'm an occasional blogger and PHP developer. I have been known to help out with Open Source, and am trying to find the time to do more of that. </p>
    <p>As you can see, the design of this site has been horribly neglected (never buy a car from a mechanic!), but in my defense, I'm a coder not a designer.</p>
